When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    I would prefer a remote repository if I want to share the work with other people 
    and/or collaborate with them. If I use to work on different computers, it could also 
    be a good idea to create a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If we are working on something, we might want to finish our current work before we 
	sync with the remote repository again. Furthermore, you might want to keep working in
	a different direction than the remote repository so you don't want any of the new 
	changes to the code in the remote repository in your local code.
