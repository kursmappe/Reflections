What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	The hidden folder .git is created where all the metadata used by git will be
	stored. Without git init, the folder would be a simple folder in the file 
	system. Git init makes it a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	The working directory is the current state of all the files on the filesystem
	level while the staging area reflects all the changes that would be done to 
	the git repository when a commit would be executed right now. This way, you
	have more flexibility because you can decide which files should be included 
	in the next commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	The staging area contains all the files that will be contained in the next
	commit. You can see the differences in the files that you are about to commit
	in contrast to the last commit by exexuting git diff --staged. If there are
	changes that should be commited separately in another commit than the next
	one, you can remove the respective file(s) from the staging area. If there
	are any files that contain changes that correspond to the same logical change,
	you can add them to the staging area so that they will be a part of the next
	commit.
